Besides having numerous features, it also has great points in terms of usability explained as follows:

#### **1. Learnability**

Our interface is designed with a strong focus on learnability, allowing users to quickly grasp its functionalities and navigate effortlessly. We provide a comprehensive tutorial that guides users through the application upon entry, offering clear instructions and explanations of each tab and feature. This introductory guide ensures that users can easily understand and make the most of the interface from the start.

#### **2. Efficiency**

Our interface excels in efficiency, for example the inclusion of a chat page has significantly improved communication with venue owners, eliminating the need for back-and-forth emails or phone calls. Users can ask questions, seek confirmation of bookings, and receive prompt responses, streamlining the process.

Additionally, the implementation of filters for more specific venue searches enhances efficiency by narrowing down options based on user preferences. Users can easily select their desired criteria at once, such as capacity, location, and amenities, resulting in a tailored list of venues. One user shared, "The filters helped me find exactly what I was looking for in no time. I think it will be very a time saver when the application is deployed for everyone."

#### **3. Safety**

By having a clear and intuitive design, MarryMe adopts a clean and intuitive design, ensuring that users can easily navigate through the app without confusion. Buttons and controls are strategically placed, reducing the risk of accidental clicks and minimizing the chances of user errors.

We also have a lot of confirmation prompts for critical actions, such as cancelling a booking venue or leaving the game while playing, are accompanied by confirmation prompts. These prompts require users to verify their intention before proceeding, adding an extra layer of caution and reducing the likelihood of unintentional mistakes.

One of our users gave the following feedback : "I like that the interface is designed with user safety in mind. The confirmation prompts have saved me multiple times from accidentally cancelling a venue when doing the tasks."

</p>

In the game part, to prevent accidentally quitting the game, a confirmation box will pop out when a user clicked on the quit (X) button and they have to reconfirm it if they actually want to quit. This ensures that users are making conscious decisions and helps to prevent unwanted loss of data or progress. The dialogs are designed to be clear and concise, asking users to confirm their intention to quit or cancel.

Similar confirmation box also shows up when canceling the booked venue.

## Iteration

<!-- **Iteration (limit: 300 words):** How did you spend the DP6 period for iteration? Why? What changes did you make? Show concrete examples and data whenever applicable. What did you learn?
 -->

In the last DP6 period, we tried to be as close as ever to our first pov; efficient process while staying fun. We implemented the following steps in the last iteration of our prototype to address usability issues, increase transparency, streamline user flows, improve readability, aiming create a more intuitive and enjoyable wedding venue selection process since this is also one of our goal from our pov (making the process fun).

Firstly, we have resolved the issue of missing images in task 1 by updating our prototype and ensuring that all images are displayed correctly when a button is clicked.

To address the lack of information indicating that the venue page was AI-generated, we have included a clear and concise statement on the page, explicitly stating that the content was generated using AI technology.

Regarding the redundancy of selecting and confirming capacity, we have streamlined the process by automatically applying the selected capacity without requiring additional confirmation.

To eliminate confusion caused by displaying game history as a filter, we have repositioned the game history feature in the filter tab when choosing venue filters. Additionally, we have revised the naming ensuring that users can easily understand and access their game history.

Recognizing the importance of date information, we have increased the font size to improve readability, allowing users to quickly identify and comprehend the date associated with each venue.

Furthermore, we have addressed the misconception caused by the red-colored pop-up confirmation box resembling an error message. This adjustment helps users associate the pop-up with successful confirmation rather than an error.

Through this iteration, we learned the importance of addressing usability issues promptly, enhancing transparency in AI-generated content, streamlining user flows, improving readability, and using appropriate visual cues for successful interactions.

For the interface contribution, I was involved in designing both low and high-fidelity prototypes. In the low-fidelity prototype, I worked on the sign-up page, home page, profile page, venue details, and booking page. For the high-fidelity prototype, I focused on the explore page, which covered the implementation of filter parameters and all their interactions, including drop-down menus and sliders.

Our project experienced a combination of triumphs and challenges. One effective practice was scheduling regular meetings and incorporating enjoyable moments within these sessions. This approach allowed us to foster personal relationships that extended beyond the professional sphere. However, we sometimes scheduled meetings too close to the deadline, which impacted my time management for other courses. We initiated working on the DP early in one instance, but were hampered by the late upload of instructions from the TA. In the future, I would prefer having guidelines for the next DP immediately after the submission deadline of the previous one.

The experience provided several lessons about teamwork. Among them is the need for efficient scheduling, early planning, and recognizing that team dynamics can be improved by nurturing both professional and personal relationships.

With regard to user-centered design process and UI prototyping, this project provided a significant learning opportunity. My prior background in graphic design proved beneficial, enabling me to apply relevant design principles. However, I realized that my design perspective might not always align with that of our diverse users. Designing for everyone, accounting for their unique perspectives and perceptions, proved challenging. As I sought to incorporate these unique details into the design, I discovered the value of the iterative process. Each iteration brought us a step closer to a prototype that could cater to everyone's needs, an exciting and rewarding journey in user-centered design.

As for the individual contribution, I was responsible for designing several components. My primary tasks included the design of the profile page, game history, and booking cancellation pages.

The profile page was a significant part of my contribution. I designed it to be user-friendly, allowing users to navigate and update their personal information easily. I incorporated features such as 'Edit Profile Info', allowing users to modify their personal details. I also added a 'Notification' setting, allowing users to customize their notification preferences. I included a 'Language Setting' feature to cater to our diverse user base, enabling users to select their preferred language. Lastly, I added a 'Privacy Policy' section to ensure users were informed about how their data is used and protected.

The game history page was designed with a clear and organized layout, allowing users to view and understand their past games easily. The booking cancellation page was another critical component I designed. I aimed to make the cancellation process as straightforward and stress-free as possible for the users, including clear instructions, confirmation prompts, and a simple interface.

Furthermore, I am glad that I have my team for this HCI project. Our team was characterized by a high level of responsibility and commitment. Each member took ownership of their assigned tasks and executed them diligently. This sense of responsibility was a significant factor in our team's success. We also shared a strong bond, which made the process of working on the project enjoyable and fostered a positive and collaborative environment.

However, as the semester progressed, we faced time management and productivity challenges. Towards the end of the semester, fatigue and other commitments impacted our ability to give our full attention to the project. We often found ourselves working on reports close to deadlines. Additionally, while our personal bond was a strength in many ways, it sometimes led to unproductive periods. We learned valuable lessons about the importance of time management, maintaining focus, and balancing work and personal interactions in a team setting.

Our HCI project's design process was a discovery and learning journey. Initially, we faced some confusion, particularly around the terminology and concepts we needed to use in our discussions. This was a challenging period but also pushed us to deepen our understanding and improve our communication. The prototyping phase was particularly enlightening. During this phase, our ideas began to take shape, and we could see the tangible results of our discussions and planning. Despite the challenges, we managed to navigate this phase effectively, resulting in a design that we are proud of.

In conclusion, the design process was a rewarding experience that taught me the intricacies of HCI design. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and working on the project with my team. The challenges we faced and the successes we achieved together have been invaluable in my learning journey. I am very proud of our team.

Throughout this project, my primary focus was on the game page, in both the low-fi and high-fi prototypes, starting from selecting the mode (single-player or multiplayer) until the AI-generated dream venue for the players. Then, as the game page is somehow the main feature we tested in the usability testing, we received numerous feedback on it, so I did a lot of design iteration for the game page.

For this project, even though there were more meetings compared to other course’s projects, scheduling and coordinating were relatively easy due to the team’s responsiveness when deciding on dates and times. During the needfinding and ideation stage, we individually generated ideas that we later combined and discussed during meetings, streamlining the process and ensuring efficient use of our time. What I like about our team was that everyone shared their ideas and voiced their opinions. There was no free-riding or blind agreement, and this collaborative atmosphere enriched our discussions. The only challenge we faced when ideating outside of meetings was the possibility of uneven contributions, with some team members generating more or fewer ideas. Then, for job distribution, we knew that it was impossible to divide the tasks fairly, so we acknowledged our individual abilities and openly discussed task distribution. Each teammate also took turns taking the lead on different aspects, preventing the burden from falling solely on one person. Overall, this project taught me the importance of effective communication, active discussions, and everyone’s initiative to contribute.

Interestingly, three out of four team members were Indonesian and already knew each other before the project. This familiarity made our meetings feel more casual and enjoyable compared to other team projects. However, this informality also presented challenges, as it was easier for us to become distracted during meetings, resulting in longer, less productive sessions towards the end of the semester. Additionally, we often found ourselves writing the report just a few hours before the deadline, but it eventually worked as we learned to write it faster throughout the semester.

A notable aspect of this project was creating a UI for a target user that did not include ourselves. This experience taught me the importance of letting go of personal preferences and adapting to suit the users’ preferences. I also learned that the choice of wording is crucial, especially considering that English is often a second language for many people. Certain phrases may make sense to individuals from specific countries but not to others. Due to our team’s lack of nationality diversity, we initially agreed on wordings quickly. However, we received numerous feedback on our word choices during the usability testing. This taught me to put myself in others’ shoes. Furthermore, designing a prototype with three other members with various design styles taught me to let go of some of my personal preferences to create a cohesive overall prototype.

In this project and prototype, I contributed on everything that is linked to the chat page. It means the page, all interactions on this page when completing our tasks and the links to this page. I also did the tutorial shown at the start of our prototype. In addition, I worked on every page that had a usability issue shown after our heuristic evaluation to fix those issues. This includes the page for setting filter when searching for a venue, the booking page and payment page and the page of detail when clicking on a venue.
About the team in general, I think our work planning was working great with regular reunions on pre-determined days, so it wasn’t a surprise each time. We were also able to communicate very well and each of us was able to express their ideas freely in the team. For the things that worked less well I would say the efficiency in the reunions. At the end of the semester, we were spending a lot of time not doing a lot. But even though this could be considered as a bad thing it also made the meetings enjoyable and fun in general (not only focused on the work). When in a hurdle I think we mainly asked for the opinion of everyone and took the solutions that had the most of votes in the team. There was not any hurdle between the members of the team so no problem from this side we were united throughout the whole semester.

With this team project, I realized the importance of communication, both in expressing my ideas and actively listening to others. Collaborating with team members and respecting their contributions has been very important for achieving success. I see more clearly the significance of clearly defining roles and responsibilities to avoid confusion and promote efficiency. Setting realistic goals and holding myself and others accountable has been instrumental in meeting project deadlines. I have also learned the value of embracing diverse perspectives and fostering a supportive team environment. Usually in my team projects we go directly for the work and only the work nothing else so this was a big change. Managing conflicts and addressing them constructively has also been an important lesson. Overall, these experiences have shaped my understanding of teamwork and will guide me in future projects to create a positive and productive working environment (while staying fun).

During the team-based design project, I learned that user-centered design and UI prototyping are essential for creating effective interfaces. Understanding user needs and preferences, iterating on design concepts, and facing the feedback while improving on it were key aspects of the process. Collaboration and communication within the team were crucial for successful prototyping. Overall, the experience highlighted the importance of user-centricity, iteration, and teamwork in creating user-friendly interfaces.
