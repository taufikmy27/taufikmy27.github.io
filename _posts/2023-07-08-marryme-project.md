During my last semester, I embarked on a fascinating journey in a Human-Computer Interaction course. My team, "Let's Get Married", and I developed an innovative solution named "MarryMe". The project aimed to simplify the process of finding a wedding venue by incorporating a user-friendly interface and a unique matching game that combines the preferences of both partners.

## Key Features

1. **Matching Game**: I designed a simple matching game where users can combine their preferences with their partner's. The algorithm I developed analyzes the best combination of their preferences. The result is an AI-generated visualization of the couple's combined preferences, aiding users in visualizing their venue.

2. **Venue Search**: I created a feature where users can search venues that match their combined preferences based on the matching game result. 

3. **Efficient Communication**: I included a chat page to improve communication with venue owners, eliminating the need for back-and-forth emails or phone calls.

4. **Safety Measures**: I implemented confirmation prompts for critical actions, such as cancelling a booking or leaving the game while playing, to prevent unintentional mistakes.

## Design Iterations

Throughout the project, we made several iterations to our design based on user feedback and heuristic evaluations. I addressed usability issues, increased transparency, streamlined user flows, and improved readability. I learned the importance of addressing usability issues promptly, enhancing transparency in AI-generated content, and using appropriate visual cues for successful interactions.

## Team Reflection

Our team was characterized by a high level of responsibility and commitment. I took ownership of my assigned tasks and executed them diligently. This sense of responsibility was a significant factor in our teamâ€™s success. We also shared a strong bond, which made the process of working on the project enjoyable and fostered a positive and collaborative environment.

## Lessons Learned

The project provided a significant learning opportunity in user-centered design process and UI prototyping. I learned the importance of letting go of personal preferences and adapting to suit the usersâ€™ preferences. I also discovered the value of the iterative process. Each iteration brought us a step closer to a prototype that could cater to everyoneâ€™s needs, an exciting and rewarding journey in user-centered design.

## Representative Screenshots

Here are some representative screenshots from the interface:

## Conclusion

This course was a turning point for me. It was the first time I felt genuinely excited about computer science. The process of designing and developing a user-centered application was both challenging and rewarding. I enjoyed every step of the journey, from brainstorming ideas to implementing features and receiving user feedback. This project has reinforced my passion for computer science, and I look forward to applying the skills and knowledge I've gained in my future endeavors.
