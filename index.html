  Interested in Computational Sustainability, Data Science, HCI, and Social Computing.
</h2>

<p> I am a junior student double majoring in Computer Science and Business and Technology Management at <a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/">KAIST</a> and an awardee of <a href="http://niied.go.kr/user/nd35203.do">Global Korea Scholarship</a> for Undergraduate Degree 2020, <a href="http://daewoongfoundation.or.kr/content/content2.asp?FolderName=sub02&filename=sub02_01">Daewoong Global Scholarship Program</a> 2022, and <a href="http://www.leewonfoundation.org/bin/minihome/neo_main758.htm?seq=9659&_aldo=154">Lee&Won Asian Fellowship</a> 2023.
<br>
<br>
I have a particular interest in Computational Sustainability, Data Science, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Social Computing. I believe these fields hold immense potential for tackling some of the most pressing challenges of our time. Outside of my academic pursuits, I'm an avid traveler and photographer, and I enjoy singing in my free time. This balance helps me bring a unique perspective to my work.
<br>
<br>
I'm always eager to learn and grow, and I'm currently seeking internship opportunities where I can apply and expand my knowledge in these areas. I'm particularly interested in roles where I can use technology to drive sustainability initiatives or address social issues. Please feel free to browse through my portfolio to see some of the projects I've worked on, or contact me if you have any opportunities or ideas to discuss. I look forward to connecting with you!
