## A little bit about me

Hello, Taufik's shere. I'm currently a junior student at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) double majoring in Computer Science and Business & Technology Management.

Before joining KAIST, I did around 4 years of gap year, working and living a nomad life while applying for fully-funded undergraduate scholarships abroad. Starting everything from zero, studying at KAIST has been a challenging yet interesting journey for me. After two years of exploration in my freshman and sophomore year, now I am trying to hone my technical skills with the hope to land an internship anytime soon.

Feel free to contact me and let's connect!
